title: Welcome to the Dragon's Cave

I'm a part-time paladin and a full-time patron of lost media, AI art tools and half-finished ideas. Tolkien, King, McCaffrey, and Classic rock FM radio shaped me. I've survived heartbreaks, layoffs, and rebirths with my dry wit and a salt-and-pepper beard reasonably intact. I dream in pinups, train in trivia, and turn chaos into storyboards, splash panels, and sometimes even strategy games!

Always seeking the rare, the real, and the remixable. Sleep-deprived, overqualified, under compensated, but still showing up!
